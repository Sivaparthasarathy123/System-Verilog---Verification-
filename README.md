# System-Verilog---Verification-
A collection of SystemVerilog verification projects demonstrating complete testbench architecture and verification practices for combinational and sequential designs.

SystemVerilog Verification
This repository contains a collection of SystemVerilog-based verification projects developed to demonstrate complete testbench architecture and industry-oriented verification practices.
The goal of this repository is to strengthen verification fundamentals through hands-on implementation of structured, reusable, and scalable SystemVerilog testbenches for both combinational and sequential digital designs.

Objectives
Build strong fundamentals in SystemVerilog verification
Understand and implement full testbench architecture
Practice real-world verification concepts used in the VLSI industry
Prepare for Verification / DV Engineer interviews
Create a reusable reference for verification learners

Testbench Architecture
Each project follows a structured SystemVerilog testbench design, including:

Interface

Transaction / Sequence Items

Driver

Monitor

Scoreboard

Environment

Test

Top-level Testbench

Assertions (where applicable)

The testbenches are self-checking, reusable, and scalable.
